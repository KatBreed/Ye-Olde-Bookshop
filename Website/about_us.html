			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<p class="para">
			Julia Appleby's Ye Olde Book Shop's purpose has always been to promote women's writing and to
			provide books reflecting women's diverse lives and interests. We also have lots of men customers
			and we welcome them. In recent years we have become one of New Zealand’s leading specialists in
			feminist and original language childrens books. As a quality, independent New Zealand bookstore,
			we are renowned for our diverse reading, our passion for books and for our personal service. This
			includes fast, efficient mail-order all over the country, and a commitment to sourcing special orders -
			if it's available we'll get it for you.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			Currently we employ one part-time staff member, Jamal Smith, who works in the shop when Julia is
			unavailable. His passion is restoration of old books and oversees any restoration work that is
			undertaken by the bookshop.
			</p>
			<p class="para">
			Julia is well regarded in the publishing world and has extensive knowledge of old books and their
			values after working many years in London and New York. She offers a valuation service and
			sometimes can connect sellers with prospective buyers – she does take a small commission for this
			service.
