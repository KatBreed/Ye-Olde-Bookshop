		<h3>Age</h3>
			<p class="para">
			When considering a book's worth, those printed before 1830 are considered to be "old" and are therefore possibly of more value. This is because after 1830 the scale of printing changed 
			and so there are likely to be more copies.
			</p>
			
		<h3>Condition</h3>
			<p class="para">
			Sometimes finding a book is easy but findindg a copy in fine mint condition can be rarer. A book in fine mint condition with a good jacket 
			can be extremely valuable and can increase a book's value tenfold.
			</p>
			
		<h3>Signatures and Other Inscriptions</h3>
			<p class="para">
			Book signings were not a thing in the past so if a book is signed by the author or someone else of note, this will increase the book's value.
			This also goes to any other drawings or notes that are present. Or if the book was owned by someone of note, that could also increase a book's 
			value more than if it was owned by Joe Bloggs.
			</p>
			
		<h3>Rarity</h3>
			<p class="para">
			How rare a book is goes towards it's value. However, even though a book is rare, it does not automatically make a book valuable. Rarity may simply be due to a small printing run for a not very importnat book.
			If the demand is not there then it doesn't matter how rare a book is. Rarity and demand goes hand in hand.
			</p>
			
		<h3>Demand</h3>
			<p class="para">
			 Rarity and demand goes hand in hand. A book without demand will not sell regardless of its condition or rarity. Demand for a book can be due to its importance or other things such as a notable owner,
			 signature, or other inscription.
			</p>
			
		<h3>First Edition</h3>
			<p class="para">
			As a general rule of thumb, the closer a book is to its first printing the more valuable it is. This is especially the case for books printed after 1900 as the scale and variety of printings and reprints began to increase.
			</p>
			
		<h3>Dust Jacket</h3>
			<p class="para">
			A good dust jacket in fine condition can increase a book's value. The are delicate and decorative. A dust jacket that is not in great conidtion can definately decrease a book's value by as much as 50%.
