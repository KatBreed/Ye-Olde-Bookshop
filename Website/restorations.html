			Repairs and restorations are wide and varied. Each book restoration is unique to each book but some issues are common. While some may need more work than others. Our resotrations services include:
			</p>
					
			<h4>Conditioning old leather (that is not dry-rotted)</h4>
			<p class="para">
			Family Bible before conditioning the leather and replacing the missing pieces.
			If the leather on your book is rubbing off in your lap or hands, there is little that can be done to restore it. There are chemical solutions that can be applied to harden things, but binding experts still 
			disagree on the usefulness of these treatments and the long-term effects. However, for restorable leather, we can condition, and often touch up the dye as well, to bring back the beauty of the original binding.
			</P>
			
			<h4>Repairing torn pages</h4>
			<p class="para">
			Document tape is an easy and safe way to repair tears. This very thin tissue tape is acid-free and virtually disappears when applied correctly. It has an acrylic adhesive, is permanent, and does not yellow with age.
			When there is a piece of a page margin missing, we can mount a new piece to replace what is missing. We use old paper salvaged from other discarded books, or new hand-milled paper if necessary. Results of 
			piece replacement can vary. Exact matches are a rarity.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Reattaching loose boards</h4>
			<p class="para">
			When the old hemp cords have broken, and the leather is weak from age, the boards will not stay intact. We can insert new hemp cords under the old and into the boards. We can also lay a flat cotton cord color 
			matched to the leather, to partially hide the break. This process gives the new hinge good strength, while making the book once again shelf presentable.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Cleaning pages</h4>
			<p class="para">
			There are a few things we can do to remove coal dust and general soil from pages.
			We do not wash pages. This is a process that is very expensive and only works on quality paper. It also requires removing pages from the sewing. Washing using bleach water to remove foxing and water stains is not recommended 
			due to the long-term effects. We do not provide de-acidification at this time.
			</p>

			<h4>Rare cloth book restoration</h4>
			<p class="para">
			In some cases, we can clean, re-dye, and re-starch old cloth.
			In this process, there is usually a need to lay new color-matched cloth under the old. Again, results vary depending upon what type of soil or stains we are trying to remove, as well as the texture and color of the binding material.
